### Hi, I'm Cher
#### I’m a PhD student at the University of St Andrews studying the role of biodiversity in coral reef productivity
I'm part of a lab that works on coral reef ecology and global biodiversity ([@BioTIMEHub](http://github.com/bioTIMEHub)). The repos here deal primarily with my community ecology research, but I have a few resources on ecoinformatics developed for the [BioTIME database](http://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk)

🐠 Currently working on improving reef fish abundance models\
<> I work mostly in R\
